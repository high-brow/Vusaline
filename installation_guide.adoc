== Removing other configs
. Steam -> Library -> Team Fortress 2 -> Uncheck/disable "Keep games saves in the Steam Cloud for Team Fortress 2".
. Local Files -> Browse... 
. From there, go to `tf\custom` and search for `.cfg` files; then, check their contents, and move or remove those (.cfg) files accordingly.
. Go to `tf\cfg` and delete **`config.cfg`**.

== Setup
. Replace launch options with:
- `-novid -nodns -nostartupsound -nohltv -nojoy -nobreakpad -nosteamcontroller -noquicktime -precachefontintlchars -disable_d3d9_hacks -nomaster -nowatchdog -nocrashdialog -hushsteam`.
- Linux specific additions: `-glslcontrolflow -arbmode`.
. Go to the link:https://github.com/high-brow/Vusaline/releases[releases section] and grab the newest zip.
. Open the zip and run **'vusaline_installer.exe'**; change the prompted directory if incorrect.
. That's it! Go out there and play TF2!

== Extra steps
. Use **`Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\zzz_vusaline_base\options.cfg`** to configure Vusaline.
. Use class configs? Move them to `Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg\class`.
. Use a custom autoexec? You can find it as autoexec2.cfg. If you haven't, you can create it to make aliases and change cvars like:
* Change Motion Blur:
- `mat_motion_blur_enabled 1` then mess with `mat_motion_blur_strength`
* Change contrast for fullscreen mode (only):
- `mat_monitorgamma`
- Allowed range: From `1.6` up to `2.6`
* Adjust Killfeed time (in seconds):
- `hud_deathnotice_time`
* Adjust Killstreak feed time (in seconds):
- `cl_hud_killstreak_display_time`
* If in need of more FPS, set the following for GPUs with a "G3D Mark" of <=1365:
- Turn off anisotropic filtering for textures (makes textures low-res looking & ugly)
- `mat_forceaniso 1`
. Instead of using `-high`, use link:https://bitsum.com[Process Lasso] or link:https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/nightly.php[Process Hacker] to set hl2.exe's affinity to always exclude CPU 0 (if you only see 4 checkboxes, avoid this), and hl2.exe's priority to High.
. Don't like something about Vusaline? Change it! link:https://github.com/high-brow/Vusaline/raw/master/vusaline_base.7z[Download the base] and change what you like! Then place the **`zzz_vusaline_base`** folder in `Team Fortress 2\tf\custom` and run **`make_base_vpk.bat`** in `Team Fortress 2\Vusaline`.

== Avoid the following
* Putting spaces in **`options.cfg`**, such as `dualcore = 1`(incorrect) instead of `dualcore=1`(correct).
* Using transparent viewmodel support in your HUD:
- Potential to mess with world props: https://youtu.be/fg5eBkmVS1c
- Adds another HUD animation, which will impact frametimes.
* Using `block_crash_reporting=0` without removing the `-nobreakpad` launch option.
* The following mods will cause instability:
- link:https://gamebanana.com/mods/206443[Robot animation fixes (by sigsegv)].
* Don't execute commands you don't know! It can get you banned on community servers if you execute say "fm_attackmode" (which doesn't exist, but a cheat used it at some point).
