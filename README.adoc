== About/FAQ
What is Vusalo? +
Vusalo is a (somewhat subjectivised) performance enhancer for TF2 that's based around improving stability, originally created by Iazos.

Why Vusaline? +
I started Vusaline with the intention to continue and improve the original Vusalo. You could think of it as an "experimental" version of Vusalo, however Vusaline also includes a lot of changes that maintain it up-to-date with the current versions of TF2.

How does Vusaline compare to other configs? +
. It's focused on game stability, CPU time reduction, and stable/smooth frametimes.
. Measures/benchmarks are taken with a profiler (very accurate), instead of FPS/Frames Per Second.
. Config files are easy to read through.
. Bad preferences are blocked off.
. Massive improvements to loading times (no FPS impact).
. Reduced memory usage (no FPS impact).

Decision making +
You can find how many of Vusalo/Vusaline's decisions were taken link:https://github.com/high-brow/Vusaline/blob/master/decision_making.adoc[here].

For VR users +
Go to `Team Fortress 2\Vusaline` and edit **`file_operations.bat`**. On the 9th line, you should find `block_vr=1`; set it to `block_vr=0`. Then, run **`revert_file_operations.bat`** and **`file_operations`** afterwards.

"The installer gives me an error!" +
Reextract **`Vusaline.zip`** and make sure all the extracted files are "as is" in the same folder (`Vusalo-master`). If an error persists, then this is most likely due to you having a custom TF2 install directory. Edit the batch file as described in step 3 of link:https://github.com/high-brow/Vusaline/installation_guide#setup[setup].

"I don't like how Vusaline does [X]!" +
Go to `Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\vusaline_configuration\cfg` and edit **`options.cfg`** to your linking. If you can't find what you're looking for there, then add it to **`autoexec2.cfg`** located in `Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg` (create it if it isn't already). If you're still unable to change what it is you want, then this is most likely a design choice. To learn more, please go link:https://github.com/high-brow/Vusaline/blob/master/decision_making.adoc[here]. If you still wish to modify the configs, go to link:https://github.com/high-brow/Vusaline/blob/master/installation_guide#extra-steps[extra steps] and follow step 5.

"I want to uninstall this crap!" +
Simply go to `Team Fortress 2\Vusaline` and run **`unins000.exe`**.
