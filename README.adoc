holy fuck i love running 12 bat files that i have to strategically place on my c drive just to get the same outcome as I could by dragging a fucking folder somewhere thank you high0brow for making the EASIEST installation method possible holy fuck it FUCKING SUCKS

how to install (very complicated!!!)
1. drag ALL contents froom the /install/ folder into your /Team Fortress 2/ folder... (SUPER COMPLLEXS I KNOW!!!)
2. navigate to /Team Fortress 2/Vusalo/ to customise & run vusalo_file_operations.bat (SUPPPPPEER HARD!!!)
3. navigate to /Team Fortress 2/tf/custom/vusalo_configuration/cfg/user/ and edit the options that you want to edit;;
4. set your launch options to `-novid -nodns -nostartupsound -nohltv -nojoy -nobreakpad -nosteamcontroller -noquicktime -precachefontintlchars -disable_d3d9_hacks -nomaster -nowatchdog -nocrashdialog -hushsteam` like a little faggot
5. launch tf2
